Possible Invalid rows: 973<br><br>String 'The ZES-IS-150X13-FAR is a ZEMREX Earthing Strap. The straps are designed to provide low impedance paths for EMG generated currents. Flexible and easy to fit they provide a low cost effective way of reducing EMC problems associated with conventional earth straps. At high frequencies the inductive resistance of round wire earth straps increases due to the 'skin effect'. This can be significantly reduced by using ZEMREX straps which present a large surface area. The straps are completely tinned to provide corrosion resistance and can be supplied with all round insulation as an option.

Additionally this torch is approved for use in group I M2 mining applications. It consists of a smooth, easy grip, ergonomic enclosure with a high output LED light source giving up to 120lm of light output and bespoke optics designed to deliver a narrow high intensity beam and at the same time, a lower output wide angle fringe light, ideal for inspection and maintenance work in conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. The single handed push button switch operation incorporates a rubberised switch cover with raised surface for easy switching even with gloved hands, whilst being shrouded to avoid inadvertent operation.

Rechargeable battery operation offers a convenient for Ex applications where a hand lamp is frequently required for long periods. It has both a Lloyds and an MCA type approval for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in marine applications. It offers the same extreme robustness and reliability for use in harsh environments found with hand lamp. The scratch and impact resistant lens is made from 6mm toughened glass. The body and lens ring is moulded in a highly resilient thermoplastic material able to withstand the drop and impact expected from heavy industrial use, even at sub-zero temperatures. Additionally the material is electrostatic non-hazardous, ensuring there is no risk of a dangerous build up of static charges. The lamp enclosure is preventing the ingress of dust and sealing against water in all conditions except submersion.
